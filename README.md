# Fancybox

__COMPONENT DESCRIPTION GOES HERE__

## Installation

The easiest way to use react-fancybox is to install it from NPM and include it in your own React build process (using [Browserify](http://browserify.org), [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), etc).

You can also use the standalone build by including `dist/react-fancybox.js` in your page. If you use this, make sure you have already included React, and it is available as a global variable.

```
npm install react-fancybox --save
```


## Usage

__BASIC USAGE__

```
import Fancybox from 'react-fancybox';

<ReactFancybox imageUrl={url}/>

import style to your scss file
```
```
@import "~react-fancybox/sass/react-fancybox.scss";
or 
@import "~react-fancybox/dist/react-fancybox.css";
```
